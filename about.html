        <h2>Who writes this thing</h2>
        <p>I'm Derek. I trade by day, build by night, and I'm a dad of 7. This newsletter is how I make sense of the markets — and share what I see.</p>
        <p>I've been trading options for years. Not in a hedge fund. Not on a prop desk. I trade from my desk at home between meetings, school pickups, and too many cups of coffee. And I write about it because most market commentary sounds like it was generated by a machine wearing a suit.</p>

        <h2>What this is</h2>
        <p>A weekly markets newsletter in plain English. No jargon, no hype, just honest analysis. Every Sunday evening, you get one email with everything that mattered in the markets that week — and what I think is coming next.</p>
        <p>I'm not going to tell you the Fed is "maintaining a hawkish posture amid tightening financial conditions." I'm going to tell you Powell said chill, rates aren't moving, and here's what that means for your trades.</p>

        <h2>Why it exists</h2>
        <p>Most market newsletters sound like they were written by a Bloomberg terminal. Cold. Jargon-heavy. Written for people who already know everything. That's not useful.</p>
        <p>I write like I'm explaining it to a friend. Because that's exactly what this is — me, telling you what I see, what I'm trading, and what I got wrong. No pretending. No guru act. Just signal. Less noise.</p>

        <h2>What you get every week</h2>
        <div class="format-grid">
          <div class="format-item">
            <h3>The Lead</h3>
            <p>The biggest market story of the week, broken down in human English. What happened, why it matters, and what comes next.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="format-item">
            <h3>The Tuition Report</h3>
            <p>A real trade I made that week. Entry, exit, result. What I learned — especially from the losses. No cherry-picking.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="format-item">
            <h3>Trade Ideas</h3>
            <p>Specific setups I'm watching. Entries, targets, risk/reward. Free readers get one. Signal Pro readers get them all.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="format-item">
            <h3>Quick Hits</h3>
            <p>The tickers that moved, the numbers that matter, and one-line takes on each. Fast, scannable, useful.</p>
